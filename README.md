Photo-Search
============

Google Images Search App

-Uses the Google Image Search API and posts the results in a 3-column collection view.

-When the user scrolls to the bottom of a page, the app requests more images and adds them to the scrollable list of images.

-The app also allows you to view past searches. 

-The Google Images Search API is deprecated, so the results could be buggy.
